# rsh
A tiny toy shell written as a learning experience and for fun

Current stuff that mostly works:

cd, ls, history, pwd, running other programs from existing PATH env variables

I plan to add a lot more stuff over time to bring it feeling closer to bash or zsh as well as some sort of simple configuration, but this is in no means meant to replace them or be in any way fully POSIX compliant
